                    <p>President Ronald Reagan 1985 Memorial Day Speach. Transcribed:</p>
                    <p>Sometime back I received in the name of our country the bodies of four marines who had died while
                        on active duty. I said then that there is a special sadness that accompanies the death of a
                        serviceman, for we're never quite good enough to them-not really; we can't be, because what they
                        gave us is beyond our powers to repay. And so, when a serviceman dies, it's a tear in the
                        fabric, a break in the whole, and all we can do is remember.</p>

                    <p>It is, in a way, an odd thing to honor those who died in defense of our country, in defense of
                        us, in wars far away. The imagination plays a trick. We see these soldiers in our mind as old
                        and wise. We see them as something like the Founding Fathers, grave and gray haired. But most of
                        them were boys when they died, and they gave up two lives -- the one they were living and the
                        one they would have lived. When they died, they gave up their chance to be husbands and fathers
                        and grandfathers. They gave up their chance to be revered old men. They gave up everything for
                        our country, for us. And all we can do is remember.</p>

                    <p>There's always someone who is remembering for us. No matter what time of year it is or what time
                        of day, there are always people who come to this cemetery, leave a flag or a flower or a little
                        rock on a headstone. And they stop and bow their heads and communicate what they wished to
                        communicate. They say, "Hello, Johnny," or "Hello, Bob. We still think of you. You're still with
                        us. We never got over you, and we pray for you still, and we'll see you again. We'll all meet
                        again." In a way, they represent us, these relatives and friends, and they speak for us as they
                        walk among the headstones and remember. It's not so hard to summon memory, but it's hard to
                        recapture meaning.</p>

                    <p>And the living have a responsibility to remember the conditions that led to the wars in which
                        our heroes died. Perhaps we can start by remembering this: that all of those who died for us and
                        our country were, in one way or another, victims of a peace process that failed; victims of a
                        decision to forget certain things; to forget, for instance, that the surest way to keep a peace
                        going is to stay strong. Weakness, after all, is a temptation -- it tempts the pugnacious to
                        assert themselves -- but strength is a declaration that cannot be misunderstood. Strength is a
                        condition that declares actions have consequences. Strength is a prudent warning to the
                        belligerent that aggression need not go unanswered.</p>

                    <p>Peace fails when we forget what we stand for. It fails when we forget that our Republic is based
                        on firm principles, principles that have real meaning, that with them, we are the last, best
                        hope of man on Earth; without them, we're little more than the crust of a continent. Peace also
                        fails when we forget to bring to the bargaining table God’s first intellectual gift to man:
                        common sense. Common sense gives us a realistic knowledge of human beings and how they think,
                        how they live in the world, what motivates them. Common sense tells us that man has magic in
                        him, but also clay. Common sense can tell the difference between right and wrong. Common sense
                        forgives error, but it always recognizes it to be error first.</p>

                    <p>We endanger the peace and confuse all issues when we obscure the truth; when we refuse to name
                        an act for what it is; when we refuse to see the obvious and seek safety in Almighty. Peace is
                        only maintained and won by those who have clear eyes and brave minds. Peace is imperiled when we
                        forget to try for agreements and settlements and treaties; when we forget to hold out our hands
                        and strive; when we forget that God gave us talents to use in securing the ends He desires.
                        Peace fails when we forget that agreements, once made, cannot be broken without a price.</p>

                    <p>Each new day carries within it the potential for breakthroughs, for progress. Each new day
                        bursts with possibilities. And so, hope is realistic and despair a pointless little sin. And
                        peace fails when we forget to pray to the source of all peace and life and happiness. I think
                        sometimes of General Matthew Ridgeway, who, the night before D-day, tossed sleepless on his cot
                        and talked to the Lord and listened for the promise that God made to Joshua: “I will not fail
                        thee, nor forsake thee.”</p>

                    <p>We're surrounded today by the dead of our wars. We owe them a debt we can never repay. All we
                        can do is remember them and what they did and why they had to be brave for us. All we can do is
                        try to see that other young men never have to join them. Today, as never before, we must pledge
                        to remember the things that will continue the peace. Today, as never before, we must pray for
                        God's help in broadening and deepening the peace we enjoy. Let us pray for freedom and justice
                        and a more stable world. And let us make a compact today with the dead, a promise in the words
                        for which General Ridgeway listened, “I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”</p>

                    <p>In memory of those who gave the last full measure of devotion, may our efforts to achieve
                        lasting peace gain strength. And through whatever coincidence or accident of timing, I tell you
                        that a week from now when I am some thousands of miles away, believe me, the memory and the
                        importance of this day will be in the forefront of my mind and in my heart.

                        Thank you. God bless you all, and God bless America.
                        -President Ronal Reagan</p>
